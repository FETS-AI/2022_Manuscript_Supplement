# Data and code for visualizations related to the Nature Communications publication: Federated Learning Enables Big Data for Rare Cancer Boundary Detection.

Provided here are csv files for data as well as scripts for proessing and visualization related to the work in the Nature Communications publication: Federated Learning Enables Big Data for Rare Cancer Boundary Detection. 

Steps for setup:
1. Create a python virtual environment(tested with Python 3.8) and install by running, 'pip install --upgrade pip' followed by, 'pip install .' from the top directory.
2. Run scripts using this virtual environment from within the scripts directory.

The scripts save images to disc and/or print latex code (for tables) to stdout.
